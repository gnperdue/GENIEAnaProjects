Random [GENIE](http://genie.hepforge.org) "analysis" scripts.

* `Diffractive`: Scripts for looking at the Rein diffractive pion production
model in GENIE and, in particular, comparing it to some figures in Rein's
paper.
* `NuECCQE`: total cross section counting for some channels interesting to
the CCQE-like analysis in MINERvA (but generally useful GENIE utils).
